## Table of Contents

Upload Component is a user interface element that enables users to upload files or media from their local device to a web application or platform. The component is essential for allowing users to share content, images, documents, and other files with the application or website.

## Default Upload

The Default Upload component allows users to select and upload a file. When a file is selected, the `onDrop` callback is triggered to handle the file selection and update the name of the selected file.

<CodePreview github="Upload" code={DefaultUploadCode}>
  <DefaultUpload />
</CodePreview>

## Horizontal Upload

To display the upload component in a `horizontal` layout, set the `horizontal` prop to `true`.

<CodePreview github="Upload" code={HorizontalUploadCode}>
  <HorizontalUpload />
</CodePreview>

## Single Upload

By default, the upload component allows users to select multiple files. To restrict users to uploading a single file, set the `multiple` prop to `false` within the `options` object.

<CodePreview github="Upload" code={SingleUploadCode}>
  <SingleUpload />
</CodePreview>

## Upload Disabled

To prevent users from uploading files, use the `disabled` prop set to `true` within the `options` props.

<CodePreview github="Upload" code={DisabledUploadCode}>
  <DisabledUpload />
</CodePreview>
